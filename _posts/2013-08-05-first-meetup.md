After almost a year, JavaScript North East is back up and running - this time for good!

## What's happening

The nature of the first meet up is to get feedback from attendees to better understand what they want from JSNE. Specifically what topics they'd like to hear more about so we can organise and curate speakers for future meetups around those topics.

## Where

The folks over at [Ignite100](http://ignite100.com/), one of Europe's top accelerator programmes have kindly donated their loft to host JSNE indefinitely. The address can be found on our [about page](/about.html).

## When

The first Monday of each month.

## How do I signup

We have our own [Eventbrite page](http://jsnortheast.eventbrite.co.uk/) all set up so you can sign up for our next event.
