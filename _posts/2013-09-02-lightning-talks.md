title: September 2nd 2013 Meetup - Lightning Talks
category: events
tagline: As the topic suggests, we're having lightning talks for Septembers meetup. We'll also be dicussing our new online presence, namely the website and Discourse forum. Finally we have also managed to blag some free hosting from Digital Ocean for JSNE attendees only. So it's defintely worth coming along!

This format consists of a 5-10 minute slot where speakers are able to talk about anything JavaScript related that interests them. The idea is to keep things light and informal so there should not be a lot of upfront preparation required for anyone wanting to speak.

The line up for this event is:

* [Kerry Gallagher](https://twitter.com/kerry350) - The Trials and Tribulations of WYSIWYG Editors - [Slides](https://github.com/Kerry350/WYSIWYG-presentation)
* [Philip Poots](https://twitter.com/pootsbook) - Hacking with [Ember.js](http://www.emberjs.com) and [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com) - [Slides](http://www.slideshare.net/pootsbook/jsne-ember) - [Demo](http://crossingtheruby.com/ember-leaflet-demo/) - [Code](https://github.com/pootsbook/ember-leaflet-demo)
* [Damian Nicholson](http://www.twitter.com/damian) - Two way data-binding in JavaScript


## jsnortheast.co.uk is our new home

We've finally managed to find a home for everything JSNE related, so make sure to bookmark us.

## Discourse

Off the back of our first meet up, everyone agreed that setting up a place to discuss future events etc would be beneficial. As a result I've managed to get an instance of [Discourse](http://discourse.jsnortheast.co.uk) running to do just that. If you haven't checked it out it's a really cool [open source project](http://www.discourse.org/) started by one of the creators of [stackoverflow](stackoverflow.com). It's built using Ruby on Rails and Ember.js so if your interested in seeing some quality code written in either, it's worth taking a look through the codebase.

## Digital Ocean

[Philip Poots](https://twitter.com/pootsbook) is on fire this month, and has managed to attain a special [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com) promo code only available to JSNE attendees. The following code **JSNORTHEAST10** is to the value of $10 which equates to 2 free months of cloud hosting!

I should add that Digital Ocean are one of the few providers who provide reliable and affordable SSD cloud instances, and I personally know a lot of developers who vouch for their fine service.
