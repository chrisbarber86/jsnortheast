A meetup for members of the North East tech community with an interest in all things JavaScript. Enthusiasts of all levels are welcome, so if your just getting in to jQuery or writing a large scale client-side application please come along!

[Tickets](https://jsnortheast.eventbrite.co.uk/) are limited so make sure to get yours quickly before they run out!

As the topic suggests, we're having lightning talks for Septembers meetup. This format consists of a 5-10 minute slot where speakers are able to talk about anything JavaScript related that interests them. The idea is to keep things light and informal so there should not be a lot of upfront preparation required for anyone wanting to speak.

Current Lineup so far:

* [Damian Nicholson](http://www.twitter.com/damian) - Two way data-binding in JavaScript 
* [Philip Poots](http://www.twitter.com/pootsbook) - Hacking with [Ember.js](http://www.emberjs.com) and [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com)

[Join the discussion](http://discourse.jsnortheast.co.uk/t/september-2013-meetup-lightning-talks/3) on this event.
