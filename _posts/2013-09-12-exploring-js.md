tagline: Predicting the Stockmarket using Twitter and Questioning the validity of MVC

This month we had two great talks lined up:

### Nabil Freeman - Predicting the Stockmarket with Twitter

Nabil's talk was inspired by a research paper which focussed on using Twitter to get a feel for what stocks people are buying, and from that becoming a billionaire by shorting or buying stocks based on the sentiment expressed in those tweets!

Nabil explained how he managed to bring this concept to life by implementing this himself in Node.js. Everything from consuming the Twitter firehose, to using custom sentiment analysis and NLP to determine whether his results were inline with historical trends on the stock market was discussed in this talk and this project will soon be open-sourced on GitHub.

### Kai - Questioning the ideals of MVC

Kai talked about the elephant in the room - specifically the Model View Controller(MVC) design pattern, its inception and how its became the cornerstone of modern web programming by separating concerns. More recently a number of client side frameworks have adopted this pattern off the back of its success on the server side.

Kai was quick to point out that in both cases, we've moved away from the traditional concept of MVC to something that's not really MVC like at all, and in doing so proposed a new design pattern for what the web development landscape could look like if we were to think more outside the box.
